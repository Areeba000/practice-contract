# Solidity Address Book Smart Contract

## Overview

This Solidity smart contract implements an address book on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can add contacts with aliases, retrieve alias names for their contacts, and remove contacts from their address book.

## Features

- **Adding Contacts**: Users can add contacts by specifying the contact's Ethereum address and an alias name. These contacts are stored on the blockchain associated with the user's address.

- **Retrieving Aliases**: Users can retrieve alias names for their contacts by providing the Ethereum address of the contact.

- **Removing Contacts**: Users can remove contacts from their address book by specifying the Ethereum address of the contact.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the Solidity smart contract using your preferred development environment.

3. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain. You can use tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat to deploy the contract.

4. Interact with the deployed contract using a tool like MyEtherWallet, Remix, or a custom user interface.

## Usage

Here's how you can interact with the contract:

- **Adding a Contact**:
  - Call the `addContact` function, providing the contact's Ethereum address and an alias name as parameters.

- **Retrieving an Alias**:
  - Call the `getAlias` function, providing the Ethereum address of the contact as a parameter. This will return the alias name associated with the contact.

- **Removing a Contact**:
  - Call the `removeContact` function, providing the Ethereum address of the contact you want to remove from your address book.
